# Bamazon-CLI


This is an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory in the database. 

After starting the program, pick a genre from the list to see all of the products we have for the specific genre. 

Input the ID of the item you would like to order and then input the quantity of the item you would like and the program will update our database with your order as well as tell you the price. If you order more than we have, it will tell you we cannot fill your order and tell you how many we have in stock.
